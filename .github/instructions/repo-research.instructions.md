# Repository Research Requirement

## Mandatory Pre-Step
- Always run the subagent **Official Docs Researcher** before creating, updating, refactoring, scaffolding, or deleting any deep technical content
- Use its findings to incorporate the most current official documentation and online references in the change.

## When not to Use
- When no technical content is being modified (e.g., purely editorial changes).
- When working outside of the specified directories.

## Examples
- ✅ Run **Official Docs Researcher** before editing instructions, prompts, agents, skills, workflows, collections, or docs.
- ✅ Include relevant official doc links when the change references platform behavior or standards.
- ❌ Do not modify content in those directories without running the subagent first.
